# Battleship
Battleship game - progromatic battleship game made in java

I created the game in java and it has one user controlled player and one AI controlled opponent. 

The program takes a lot of code and a lot of checks and balances. 

I put some jokes in to hopefully increase the fun factor. The game is played entirely in the console. The code is not the prettiest. It is all done in one script and can be confusing to read, but I hope you find something usefull.

Below are some pics.
